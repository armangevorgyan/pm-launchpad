# PRODUCT MANAGER CAREER TRANSITION PLAN

**12-Week Roadmap | March – June 2026**

From Banking Project Manager to IT Product Manager
Target Market: Yerevan, Armenia

---

## First: What Does a Product Manager Actually Do?

Before learning anything, it's critical to understand what a PM does (and doesn't do). Many people confuse Product Manager with Project Manager or Scrum Master.

| | Product Manager | Project Manager | Scrum Master |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owns** | WHAT to build and WHY | HOW to deliver on time | Agile process and team flow |
| **Key question** | "Are we building the right thing?" | "Are we on schedule?" | "Is the team working well?" |
| **Decides** | Features, priorities, roadmap | Timelines, resources, risks | Sprint format, retrospectives |
| **Measures** | User metrics, revenue, retention | Budget, deadlines, scope | Velocity, team health |
| **Tools** | Amplitude, Productboard, Notion | Jira, MS Project, Gantt charts | Jira board, sprint tools |
| **Reports to** | CPO / Head of Product | PMO / Operations | Engineering Manager |

**🔴 Key mindset shift:** Stop thinking about delivery timelines. Start thinking about user problems, business value, and what NOT to build. A PM's best skill is saying no to features that don't matter.

## What to Learn: Core PM Frameworks

These frameworks come up in every PM interview and daily PM work. Master them in this order:

### Product Discovery & User Research

| Framework | What It Is | How to Practice |
|---|---|---|
| Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) | "When I [situation], I want [motivation], so I can [outcome]." Understanding WHY users use products. | Write JTBD statements for 5 apps you use daily |
| User Interviews | Structured conversations to uncover user pain points. Never ask "would you use X?" | Interview 3 friends about an app they use. Practice open-ended questions. |
| User Personas | Fictional but data-backed profiles of target users with goals, frustrations, context. | Create 2 personas for Idram or Telcell based on your banking knowledge |
| User Journey Mapping | Visual map of every step a user takes to accomplish a goal, with pain points. | Map the journey of opening a bank account at AraratBank |
| Problem Validation | Proving a problem exists before building a solution. Surveys, interviews, data. | Identify a real problem in an Armenian app and validate it with 5 users |

### Prioritization & Strategy

| Framework | What It Is | Interview Tip |
|---|---|---|
| RICE Scoring | Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort. Objective feature prioritization. | Always use RICE when asked "how would you prioritize?" |
| North Star Metric | The single metric that captures core product value (e.g., DAU, bookings/week). | Be ready to define a North Star for any product |
| OKRs | Objectives (qualitative goals) + Key Results (measurable outcomes). Not to-do lists. | You likely know KPIs from banking — OKRs are similar but more ambitious |
| Product Roadmap | Strategic plan showing what you'll build and why, NOT a Gantt chart with dates. | Outcome-based roadmaps > feature-based roadmaps |
| Opportunity Solution Tree | Visual framework connecting outcomes → opportunities → solutions → experiments. | From Teresa Torres' book — very modern, impresses interviewers |
| Value vs Effort Matrix | Simple 2x2 grid: high value + low effort = do first. Quick prioritization tool. | Good for whiteboard exercises in interviews |

### Product Metrics & Analytics

| Concept | What It Means | Why PMs Must Know This |
|---|---|---|
| Funnel Analysis | Tracking users through steps: Visit → Signup → Activate → Pay → Retain | You'll analyze these daily to find where users drop off |
| Cohort Analysis | Grouping users by signup date/behavior to track retention over time | Shows if product changes actually improve things long-term |
| A/B Testing | Showing two versions to different users and measuring which performs better | How PMs validate decisions with data, not opinions |
| SaaS Metrics: MRR, ARR | Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue — the lifeblood of subscription businesses | Critical for B2B/SaaS PM roles |
| CAC / LTV / Churn | Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, Churn Rate | If LTV > CAC, business is healthy. PMs must track this. |
| DAU/MAU Ratio | Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users. Measures product stickiness. | Higher ratio = users come back more often = healthier product |

---

## Tools a Product Manager Actually Uses

**🔴 Important:** These are Product Manager tools, not Project Manager/Scrum Master tools. Jira and sprint boards are NOT your primary focus.

### Must-Know Tools (Learn These)

| Tool | PM Uses It For | Free? | Time to Learn |
|---|---|---|---|
| Amplitude | Product analytics: funnels, retention, user behavior. THE PM analytics tool. | Free tier | 1 week |
| Productboard | Feature prioritization, roadmapping, collecting user feedback. PM-specific tool. | Free trial | 3-4 days |
| Figma | Quick wireframes and prototypes to communicate ideas to engineers. NOT detailed design. | Free tier | 1 week basics |
| Notion | Writing PRDs, specs, strategy docs, meeting notes. PM's writing tool. | Free tier | 2-3 days |
| Miro / FigJam | User journey maps, brainstorming, workshop facilitation, strategy mapping. | Free tier | 1-2 days |
| Hotjar | Heatmaps and session recordings. See exactly how users interact with your product. | Free tier | 2 days |
| Maze | User testing and research. Run usability tests on prototypes. | Free tier | 2 days |

### Good to Understand (Don't Deep-Learn)

| Tool | Why Know It | Depth Needed |
|---|---|---|
| Jira / Linear | You'll write tickets and manage the backlog, but sprint management is Scrum Master's job | Backlog side only |
| Mixpanel | Alternative to Amplitude. Some companies use it. Same concepts. | Know it exists |
| Google Analytics | Website-level analytics. PMs use it but it's not product-specific. | Basic understanding |
| Looker / Metabase | Data dashboards. Data team usually builds these, PM reads them. | Read dashboards |
| Slack / Communication | You already know team communication tools from banking. | Already know |

---

## Online Courses (Pick 2)

Don't overdo courses. Books + practice > watching videos. Pick maximum 2:

| Course | Platform | Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Digital Product Management" — University of Virginia | Coursera | Free to audit | Best overall foundation. Start here. |
| "Become a Product Manager" — Cole Mercer | Udemy | ~$15 | Very practical, has real deliverables and exercises |
| "Product Management Fundamentals" — Product School | Free on YouTube | Free | Good supplement, watch specific topics you need |
| "Reforge" programs | reforge.com | $$$ | Premium. Best in industry but expensive. Maybe later in career. |

## How Arman Can Help: Engineer's Support Guide

As a senior software engineer, you can teach things no book or course can. Here's your role week by week:

| Week | Your Role | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Explain the engineer-PM dynamic | Share how your team works with PMs. What makes a good/bad PM from an engineer's perspective. |
| 2 | Walk through real backlogs | Show her your Jira/Linear. Explain what makes good tickets, bad PRDs. How engineers estimate. |
| 3 | Teach system architecture basics | Draw a simple system diagram: frontend, backend, API, database. Use banking app as example. |
| 4 | Review her wireframes | Give feedback as an engineer: "this is easy to build" vs "this needs a database migration." |
| 5 | Challenge her teardown | Review Portfolio Piece #1. Ask tough technical questions. Push on feasibility. |
| 6 | Explain event tracking | Show how analytics events are implemented in code. What's realistic to track. |
| 7 | Review her PRD as an engineer | Read her PRD and give feedback: Is it clear? Are acceptance criteria testable? What's missing? |
| 8 | First mock interview | Ask PM interview questions. Be honest and detailed with feedback. Don't go easy. |
| 9 | Second mock interview | Include technical questions: "The API is returning 500 errors after launch — what do you do?" |
| 10 | Resume + network | Review her resume. Introduce her to PMs and product people in your network. |
| 11 | Third mock interview | Full simulation. Include presentation/case study if relevant. |
| 12 | Offer evaluation | Help evaluate offers: product area, team, growth potential, compensation. |

### Key Technical Concepts to Teach Her

She doesn't need to code. But she needs to understand these so she can have informed conversations with engineers:

| Concept | Explain It Like This | Why PM Needs It |
|---|---|---|
| API (REST) | "A menu for software. Frontend orders, backend cooks, API is the waiter." | PMs discuss API design in specs |
| Frontend vs Backend | "Frontend = what users see. Backend = the engine room. Database = the warehouse." | Know where features live technically |
| Database & Data Model | "How data is organized. Like a spreadsheet but more structured." | Affects what's possible to build and track |
| Technical Debt | "Shortcuts taken to ship faster. Like a loan — you pay interest later." | PMs must balance speed vs quality |
| Deployment & CI/CD | "How code goes from engineer's laptop to users. Like publishing a book." | Understand release cycles and rollbacks |
| Caching | "Saving frequently used data nearby so it's faster. Like keeping salt on the table." | Affects performance conversations |
| Estimation | "Engineers estimate in complexity, not time. A '3' is twice as hard as a '1'." | Don't ask "how many hours?" Ask complexity. |

---

**Final Note:** The transition from Banking PM to IT Product Manager is one of the most natural pivots in tech. She already has 70% of the skills: stakeholder management, cross-team coordination, understanding business requirements, and working under pressure. The remaining 30% — product discovery, data-driven prioritization, and technical fluency — is exactly what this 12-week plan covers. With focused effort and a senior engineer as a mentor, a June 2026 start date is very achievable.
